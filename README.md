## Development:

#### Pre-requirements:

Some development scripts require [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2).
If you are planning to use them, install [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) globally.

#### Clone project and install dependencies:

1.`git clone https://github.com/k10wl/viridis`  
2.`cd viridis`  
3.`yarn install`

#### Populate .env files with required info.

Applications require `.env` file to work, set them up before launching applications.   
Make sure that all packages, that have `.env-example` also have `.env` file next to it.   
To correctly setup project environmental variables, copy `.env-exmaple` file and populate it with data.

### Workspaces short information:

Workspaces are contained in `packages` folder.

| Workspace                          | Shortcut      |
|------------------------------------|---------------|
| **_Client_** React application     | `yarn client` |
| **_Server_** created using Express | `yarn server` |
| **_Shared_** types and constants   | `yarn shared` |

### Local development:

You can either use [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) for local development or vanilla scripts.   
Using vanilla way may be a bit slower because of the parallel processes.   
Anyway, here are two tables.
The first table requires [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2).
The second one does not.   
What should you use?
Up to you âœ¨.

| Action that use [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) | Script               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Run client, server and storybook processes               | `yarn dev`           |
| Run client only                                          | `yarn dev:client`    |
| Run server only                                          | `yarn dev:server`    |
| Run storybook only                                       | `yarn dev:storybook` |
| Stop all processes                                       | `yarn dev:stop`      |
| Restart all processes                                    | `yarn dev:restart`   |
| Monitor  processes                                       | `yarn dev:monitor`   |

| Vanilla actions           | Script                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Run client without pm2    | `yarn client dev`       |
| Run server without pm2    | `yarn server dev`       |
| Run storybook without pm2 | `yarn client storybook` |

### CI:

To ease maintenance, this project uses [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).   
Make sure your code passes ESLint requirements and the tests are passing.
If any of the mentioned above conditions fails - you won't be able to commit.

| Action                                               | Script             |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Run all tests                                        | `yarn test`        |
| Run client tests                                     | `yarn client:test` |
| Run server tests                                     | `yarn server:test` |
| Check for errors and enforce code style using ESLint | `yarn eslint:fix`  |
